# Exiv2::Ruby
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stestaub/exiv2-ruby.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stestaub/exiv2-ruby)

A Ruby wrapper for the awesome [exiv2](http://www.exiv2.org/) library. The goal of this gem is to provide easy access to most of the exiv2 libraries API, but most importantly, to preview extraction and reading/writing metadata.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'exiv2-ruby'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install exiv2-ruby

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
